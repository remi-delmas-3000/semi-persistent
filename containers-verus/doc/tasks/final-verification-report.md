# Final verification report — `containers-verus` on `d21-exec`

Evidence package required by
[semi-persistence-completion-goal.md](semi-persistence-completion-goal.md)
("Evidence required to close the step"): per-container contract/verification
matrix, trust inventory, gate report, performance comparison (in
[final-performance-report.md](final-performance-report.md)), and the signed
local commits. Nothing on this branch has been pushed; `containers/` (the
legacy oracle) is unchanged since `d191c4a` (`git diff --quiet d191c4a --
containers`).

## 1. Commits (signed, local)

| Commit | Content |
|---|---|
| `e28ac37` | Trail migration preservation groundwork |
| `bbb9548` | Trail → Hot: checked hash-set first-capture dedupe (`trail_select::dedupe_trail_range`, keyed by the generic index `I` through `IndexHasher`), plan buffers removed |
| `990eb08` | Hot → Cold: checked migration over the in-place std slice sort (`std_sort::sort_pairs_by_index`, the one trusted std contract) |
| `a831cc1` | Rollover dispatch: configured/forced rollover, mark fallback, tier policy and adaptive passes checked; `Ratio` moved inside `verus!` |
| `328c512` | Derived restore contracts (ListArena, EClasses roots, SpMap, CircularList, UnionFind, BPlusTreeSet) and group member models/archives (`SyncMember`, `ForkHistory`) |
| `9df28cb` | `pending_restore_indices` checked with an exact contract; `sequence_witness_checked` (production instantiation of the sequence theorem); interface inventory |
| `09f00b0` | EClasses component contents (entries, reprs, uses, pool) through `restore`/`try_restore`; benchmark protocol frozen |
| `2f99644` | `try_mark_adaptive` marker removed (trust 50 + 5); benchmark-attributed constant-factor fixes (pre-sized dedupe buffers, single-bound byte fold); ledgers, CI trust constant, this report and the performance investigation |
| `f304bc7` | B+ tree above legacy speed (cursor leaf cache, single validation, fused leaf fill, incremental `last_leaf`), 10M/100M bench sweep, find-sweep bench loop fix |
| `45fc132` | final two-run benchmark results appended to the performance report; goal extended with the caching, store-policy and `VecD` work (handoff "Next actions") |
| `987a964` | Extended goal 1(a): the Trail-to-Hot dedupe set cached on the vector (`trail_seen`), five edge-of-budget proofs decomposed, per-mark small-frame rollover benchmark (1.09×) |

## 2. Per-container contract / verification matrix

All bodies below are verified unless a trust marker is named; markers are
classified in §3. "Exact" means the postcondition is an equality over the
container's abstract model, not an approximation. `S[k]` is the archived
snapshot at frame `k`.

| Container (public type) | Mutation and mark | Restore | Trust markers in the module |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Vec` (three-tier semi-persistent vector) | constructors: `wf`, empty view and history; `set_index`/`try_push`/`pop`: view updated exactly, snapshots unchanged; `try_mark*`: view unchanged, depth + 1, snapshots pushed with the old view, rejection leaves the model unchanged; rollover in any legal order (`flush_trail`, `compress_hot`, `apply_tier_policy`, `apply_adaptive`, configured/forced rollover on mark): `tiers_only_changed` — view, depth, snapshots, canonical history, store and policy unchanged | `try_restore`/`restore`: view `= S[k]`, depth `= k`, snapshots `= S[..k]`; rejection unchanged; `pending_restore_indices`: `Some` iff restorable and the set is exactly the indices captured by frames in `[k, depth)`; `sequence_witness_checked` composes mark/write/restore/rollover end to end from these contracts alone | 5 byte reporters/diagnostics (`log_heap_bytes`, `log_shrink_capacity`, `diff_log_len`, `tracking_bytes`, `total_bytes`) |
| `AppendOnlyVec` | push appends exactly; mark exact | `try_restore`: view `= S[k]`, depth `= k`, prefix | `shrink_aov_capacity` (capacity only) |
| `SpMap` | insert appends to the log; index agrees with the log | `try_restore`/`restore`: log `= S[k]`, depth `= k`, prefix; index rebuilt from the surviving log; rejection unchanged | `clone_key_exact` (key-model projection) |
| `SparseSet` | insert/remove exact over dense/sparse/indices | `restore`: dense, sparse and indices views `= S[k]`, archives truncated; requires the archived snapshot well-formed (component-boundary precondition, established by `EClasses`) | `values_equal` (unconstrained bool) |
| `CircularList` | splice/walk exact over entries and ring model; splice requires distinct rings (component-boundary precondition) | `try_restore`: entries and model views `= S[k]`, both archives truncated; `Err` leaves the state unchanged | `debug_check_different_rings` (debug diagnostic) |
| `ListArena` | append/iterate exact over heads, nodes and model | `try_restore`: heads, nodes and model views `= S[k]` at one shared frame, three archive prefixes; `Err` unchanged | `white_box_head` (test accessor), `tracking_bytes`, `total_bytes` |
| `UnionFind` | union/find exact over roots, parent and rank | `try_restore`: roots, parent and rank views `= S[k]`, roots and parent archive prefixes, parent and rank marks agree; `Err` unchanged | — |
| `EClasses` | merge/find exact over roots; `min_width` preserved | `restore`/`try_restore` under full validity (which `try_restore` checks): roots, size, depth, roots archive prefix, and every component column and archive prefix (entries model and nodes, reprs dense/sparse/indices, uses model, minimum pool); `Err` unchanged | — |
| `BPlusTreeSet` (+ cursors) | insert/bulk-load exact over the ghost tree (bulk load through the total `leaf_fill_keys`, order checks branch-free); branchless search verified; cursor `seek`/`seek_first`/`key`/`step` exact against the in-order model under `cursor_ok` (positioning plus the cached leaf) | `restore`: tree `= S[k]`, arena and tree archive prefixes | 5 bounds-elided array/slice primitives in `bplus_layout` |
| `HintedArena` | set/push exact; `complete()` preserved | `restore`: view `= S[k]`, prefix; `Err` unchanged | — |
| `ForkHistory` / `SyncMember` (group wrappers) | `mark`: every member model unchanged, one archived model per member | `restore`: every member model at the token's depth, archive prefix; rejection unchanged; `mark_parallel`/`restore_parallel` carry the same contracts over the rayon fan-out (trusted dispatch, ledger 3.6d) | `mark_parallel`, `restore_parallel`, `checksum` |
| `History` (group token authority) | `mark`: `wf`, depth + 1 (requires depth `< u32::MAX`) | `restore_to`: `wf`, depth `= t` (requires a valid token below the depth) — both partial public functions, see §5 | — |
| Stores and encoders (`DiffStore`: `InlineStore`, `ParallelStore`, Trail; `ColdStack`, `CompressedStack`, `TwoStackLog`, `GenStamps`, `LayeredSpanMap`, `DenseSpanMap`, `SortedCursor`, `SortedVecCursor`, `IdFactory`) | verified functional contracts on every executable body (run encoding/decoding, capture bits, span maps, cursors); they have no snapshot model of their own and are consumed by the containers above | n/a | byte reporters (`heap_bytes` ×6, `data_capacity_bits`, `shrink_vec_capacity`), diagnostics and environment levers (`compression_stats` ×10, `compression_config` ×2, `diff_compress::choose_mode`), `std_sort::sort_pairs_by_index`, `par_sum_canary` |

Migration coverage required by the goal (duplicates, empty and gapped frames,
non-empty destination prefixes, different legal migration orders) is proved in
the migration lemmas named in `three-tier-proof-progress.md` (sections "Trail
deduplication and migration primitives", "Hot-to-Cold migration primitives",
"Rollover dispatch") and exercised by the release differential policy matrix.

## 3. Trust inventory (final source)

Re-derived from `grep '#[verifier::external_body]'` on the final source:
**50 default-build markers + 5 gated by `literal-types`** (the session started
at 74 + 5), **4 default axioms** (`axiom_index_hasher_builds_valid_hashers`;
`obeys_key_model` for `DenseId31`, `DenseId63`, `DenseUsize`, plus one generated
per `define_id*!` id type) **+ 5 gated axioms**, no `admit`/`assume` in project
sources (CI-checked). Every default marker, by ledger group:

| Group | Items (50) |
|---|---|
| A — opaque identity (3) | `struct ContainerId`, `ContainerId::new`, `ContainerId::eq` |
| B — unmodeled std behaviour: byte reporters, no `ensures` (12) | `Vec::{tracking_bytes,total_bytes,log_heap_bytes,diff_log_len}`, `ListArena::{tracking_bytes,total_bytes}`, `heap_bytes` in `CaptureBits`, `CompressedStack`, `diff_compress`, `GenStamps`, `InlineStore`, `ParallelStore` |
| B — capacity helpers, contract = contents unchanged (4) | `shrink_vec_capacity`, `shrink_aov_capacity`, `Vec::log_shrink_capacity`, `data_capacity_bits` (`capacity >= len`) |
| B — bounds-elided array/slice primitives, `bplus_layout` (5) | `arr_get`, `arr_set`, `slice_get`, `sel_usize`, `arr_shift_up` |
| B — std slice sort contract (1) | `std_sort::sort_pairs_by_index` (permutation in non-decreasing key order, nothing else touched) |
| C — runtime guards (2) | `guard::check_precondition`, `guard::refuse` |
| D — key model and hasher registrations (3) | `map::clone_key_exact`, `ExIndexHasher`, `ExFoldHasher` |
| E — glue (3) | `sparse_set::values_equal` (unconstrained bool), `circular_list::debug_check_different_rings`, `list::white_box_head` |
| F — diagnostics, levers, parallel dispatch (17) | `compression_stats` ×10 (`frame_stats`, `observe`, `observe_frame`, `shadow_enabled`, `shadow_emit`, `shadow_log_copy`, `shadow_log_full`, `run_count_writeorder`, `run_count_sorted`, `mode_name`), `compression_config::{env_compress_default,env_diff_store_kind}`, `diff_compress::choose_mode`, `sync_group::{mark_parallel,restore_parallel}` (rayon fan-out over the members' checked contracts, ledger 3.6d), `sync_group::checksum`, `parallel::par_sum_canary` |

No default marker carries a postcondition about container contents; the only
contract-carrying ones restate documented std behaviour (capacity, sort,
indexing) or the hasher/key-model facts. The last execution-first `Vec`
marker, `try_mark_adaptive`, is removed in the final checkpoint.

## 4. Gate report (final source)

Run on the final source (Verus 0.2026.08.02 / vstd 2026-08-02, rustc 1.97.1,
macOS 27.0, Apple M4 Pro), each Verus run after touching `src/vec.rs` so
nothing was served from cache; logs `/tmp/sp-d21-final-*.log`:

| Gate | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Full crate, default features | `cargo verus verify` | 2590 verified, 0 errors |
| Full crate, `literal-types` | `cargo verus verify --features literal-types` | 2590 verified, 0 errors |
| Conditional composition (Step 3 theorem) | `verus --crate-type lib containers-verus/proofs/top_down/composition.rs` | 80 verified, 0 errors |
| `au-verus` | `cargo verus verify` (in `au-verus/`) | 29 verified, 0 errors |
| Feature/runtime suite | `cargo test -p semi-persistent-containers-verus --features 'compat-all,literal-types'` | 277 passed, 0 failed, 10 ignored |
| Release differential policy matrix | `PROPTEST_CASES=1024 cargo test -p containers-conformance --release --test three_tier_policy_matrix` | 4 passed |
| Consumers (e-graph, SAT core) | `cargo test -p semi-persistent-satcore -p semi-persistent-egraph` | 1267 passed, 0 failed, 45 ignored |
| Canary | `cargo test -p containers-verus-canary --features compat-all` | 2 passed |
| Partial-API audit | `tools/check_partial_api.py` | 73 partial / 33 allowed / 40 unlisted / 0 unsafe — pre-existing, open (§5) |
| Formatting, whitespace | `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `git diff --check` | clean |
| Legacy oracle unchanged | `git diff --quiet d191c4a -- containers` | unchanged |
| Trust count (CI method) | grep of `#[verifier::external_body]` | 50 default + 5 gated (`EXPECTED_DEFAULT=50`) |

The 10 ignored feature tests and 45 ignored consumer tests are the suites'
pre-existing ignores (feature-gated or long-running), unchanged by this branch.

## 5. Partial-API discrepancy (open final-audit item)

`tools/check_partial_api.py` reports 73 public executable functions with a
Verus `requires`, 33 allowlisted and 40 not, 0 public `unsafe`. The 40 were
present before this proof drive and are unchanged by it. Exposure review:

- All 40 live in modules declared `pub mod` in `lib.rs` (`cold_stack`,
  `compressed_stack`, `diff_compress`, `diff_store`, `gen_stamps`,
  `hinted_arena`, `history`, `layered`, `sync_group`, `two_stack_log`,
  `value_compressor`, `vec`), so they are reachable from safe external Rust.
- Two are relied on by the e-graph: `History::mark` (requires depth
  `< u32::MAX`) and `History::restore_to` (requires a valid token below the
  depth); the e-graph establishes both by its own runtime checks
  (`egraph/src/egraph.rs`, "The depth guard is History::mark's
  precondition"). These are the only offenders with a production caller
  outside the crate; the policy's preferred fix is a `Result`-returning total
  pair next to them.
- `sync_group::{seal_frame, restore_frame, add_member}` and `vec::seal_frame`
  are `SyncMember` trait methods (public by the checker's pub-trait rule),
  called only by the group wrappers, which prove their preconditions.
- The remaining 33 are component internals (`ColdStack` sealing and
  frame restore, `diff_compress`/`layered`/`value_compressor` encoders,
  `HintedArena`, `GenStamps`, `TwoStackLog`, `DiffStore::restore_overlay`)
  used by in-crate callers and by the conformance tests. They fit the policy's
  "Inaccessible Store Receivers" / "Component-Boundary Preconditions"
  classes only if their modules stop being `pub mod` or their receivers stop
  being constructible externally, neither of which is true today.

The goal document forbids bulk-allowlisting. No entries were added; the item
remains open and CI's partial-API check does not pass on this branch, exactly
as it did not at `d191c4a`.
