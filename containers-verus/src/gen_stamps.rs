//! Generation stamps: the token authority's memory, one stamp per live depth.
//!
//! A `GenStamps` hands out stamps from a counter that only grows, so every
//! stamp is handed out exactly once. Depth `d` is live iff `d < len`; a token
//! `(d, g)` is valid iff `d` is live and `levels[d] == g`. A cut at depth `d`
//! is `len := min(len, d)`: one write, no rewriting of the stamps above the
//! cut (they are stale because they are beyond the live length). A mint at
//! the live length stores the next counter value: one write. Both are O(1),
//! whatever the deepest depth ever reached; capacity is kept across cuts so a
//! restore never reallocates, and live memory stays O(deepest depth).
//!
//! Why a consumed token never revives: a token's stamp was `next` when it was
//! minted and `next` only grows, so the stamp is below the counter for ever;
//! re-minting the token's depth stores a value at or above the counter, never
//! the token's own. `mint_at`'s last postcondition states exactly that: every
//! stamp below the old counter keeps its validity status across a mint.
//!
//! Predecessor (2026-09-17, replaced the same day after the provenance
//! benchmarks): one stamp per depth for the deepest depth ever reached, and a
//! cut at `d` bumped every level from `d` up — O(deepest depth) per restore,
//! which cost 1.1–1.7× on every mark/restore-dominated benchmark.
